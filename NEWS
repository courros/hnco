* Version 0.6 (unreleased)

Library:
- Population: added get_bv for const instances
- Added bv_flip with a sparse_bit_vector_t mask
- Neighborhood: added _flipped_bits
- Neighborhood: added pure virtual method sample_bits
- Neighborhood defines methods propose, keep, and forget
- Local search: new files neighborhood-iterator.(hh|cc) and steepest-ascent-hill-climbing.(hh|cc)
- Removed file one-plus-one-ea.cc
- OnePlusOneEa implemented as a NonStrictRandomLocalSearch with a Binomial neighborhood
- Incremental evaluation: OneMax
- Incremental evaluation: NonStrictRandomLocalSearch
- Incremental evaluation: StopOnMaximum, StopOnTarget, CallCounter, ProgressTracker, OnBudgetFunction
- Incremental evaluation: Negation
- All function decorators moved under decorators/

* Version 0.5 (2017-04-26)

Library:
- Function: added methods safe_eval and update
- ProgressTracker: renamed method update -> update_last_improvement
- Population: added method eval for parallel evaluation with OpenMP
- Algorithms with parallel evaluation: Pbil, NpsPbil, Umda, Hea,
  MuCommaLambdaEa, MuPlusLambdaEa, GeneticAlgorithm, BmPbil
- New type point_value_t
- Algorithm: changed type of _solution: bit_vector_t -> point_value_t
- New exceptions: PointValueException, TargetReached
- Added function decorator StopOnTarget
- ProgressTracker: catch TargetReached
- CallCounter, OnBudgetFunction: _num_calls is incremented AFTER evaluation of _function

hnco:
- Added options: --stop-on-target, --target, --num-threads
- Added exit status in case of missed maximum (2) or missed target (3)
- Renamed option --print-performances -> --print-performance
