abstract = {A new class of test functions for black box optimization is introduced. Affine OneMax
(AOM) functions are defined as compositions of OneMax and invertible affine maps on
bit vectors. The black box complexity of the class is upper bounded by a polynomial
of large degree in the dimension. Tunable complexity is achieved by expressing invertible
linear maps as finite products of transvections. Finally, experimental results are
given to illustrate the performance of search algorithms on AOM functions.},
