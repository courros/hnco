// There are many ways to perform local search, and this
// file contains the implementation for a lot of configuration options.
// In all published experiments (so far) "first_improvement" was used,
// for the Random Restart HC and P3, with "no_action" used for LTGA and hBOA.
// Other methods were informally tested.
