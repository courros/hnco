// The Middle Layer sits between the optimization
// method and the problem that is being optimized in order to perform
// evaluation counting and progression tracking.  It records
// each time a new best fitness is reached and the evaluation at
// which it was first found.  When configured, this will also output
// the genotype of the solution which found the new best fitness.
