/** Four Peaks.

    It is defined by

    f(x) = max{head(x, 1) + tail(x, 0)} + R(x)

    where:
    - head(x, 1) is the length of the longest prefix of x made of ones;
    - tail(x, 0) is the length of the longest suffix of x made of zeros;
    - R(x) is the reward;
    - R(x) = n if (head(x, 1) > t and tail(x, 0) > t);
    - R(x) = 0 otherwise;
    - the threshold t is a parameter of the function.

    This function has four maxima, of which exactly two are global
    ones.

    For example, if n = 6 and t = 1:
    - f(111111) = 6 (local maximum)
    - f(111110) = 5
    - f(111100) = 10 (global maximum)
